# INTRODUCTION
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of supply chain operations using Microsoft Excel as the primary analytical tool. The dataset contains transactional records related to product orders, shipment timelines, customer regions, and sales performance, simulating the core processes of a mid-sized logistics or retail company. The analysis focuses on uncovering operational insights through data transformation, pivot tables, KPI tracking, and data visualization. Key areas of focus include order fulfillment efficiency, category-level sales trends, delivery lead times, and regional performance patterns. This project demonstrates a practical application of spreadsheet-based analytics for business intelligence and supply chain management. It showcases expertise in transforming raw operational data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making, operational optimization, and performance monitoring.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
I undertook this project to explore, analyze, and extract insights from a structured supply chain dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful information that could support decision-making in logistics, operations, and inventory management. While working with the dataset, I focused on answering the following key business questions:
* Which product category generated the most sales?
* Which customer generated the most revenue for the company?
* What is the average time between order date and ship date?
* Which region had the highest number of orders?
* How many units were sold per product?
* Which product category has the fastest delivery rate?
* What is the relationship between quantity sold and profit generated?
